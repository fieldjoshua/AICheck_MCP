# AICheck MCP

AICheck is a Multimodal Control Protocol that helps Claude Code follow structured development practices.

## Installation (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the AICheck MCP repository
git clone https://github.com/fieldjoshua/AICheck_MCP.git
cd AICheck_MCP
```

### Step 2: Run Setup Scripts

```bash
# Run all setup scripts
./setup_aicheck_complete.sh  # Core AICheck setup
./setup_aicheck_hooks.sh     # Git hooks setup
./setup_aicheck_status.sh    # Status display setup

# Load shell configuration to activate commands
source ~/.zshrc  # Or source ~/.bashrc for Bash users
```

### Step 3: Activate in Claude

```bash
# Generate activation text
./activate_aicheck_claude.sh

# If the file doesn't open automatically, open it manually
open /tmp/aicheck_prompt.md

# Copy text from this file, then paste to Claude in a new conversation
```

**Note**: After running the activation script, if the file doesn't open automatically, you can find it at `/tmp/aicheck_prompt.md`. Simply open this file, copy all its contents, and paste it to Claude in a new conversation.

## What AICheck Does

AICheck gives Claude a structured workflow with:
- Action-based task management
- Documentation templates
- Dependency tracking
- Git hook suggestions
- Status display

## Commands You Can Use

After setup, Claude understands these commands:

```
/aicheck status                    # Show current action status
/aicheck action new ActionName     # Create a new action
/aicheck action set ActionName     # Switch to an action
/aicheck action complete           # Complete current action
/aicheck dependency add NAME VER   # Add external dependency
```

## Status Display

Run `aicheck_status` anytime to see:
- Current action and progress
- Git branch and status
- Last commit time

## Using in Other Projects

To use AICheck in a different project:

1. Copy the setup scripts to your project:
```bash
cp AICheck_MCP/*.sh /path/to/your/project/
```

2. Run the setup scripts in your project:
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project/
./setup_aicheck_complete.sh
./setup_aicheck_hooks.sh
./setup_aicheck_status.sh
```

3. Activate as described above.

## Troubleshooting

### Activation Text Not Opening

If the activation file doesn't open automatically:
```bash
# Open the file manually
open /tmp/aicheck_prompt.md

# Or display it in terminal
cat /tmp/aicheck_prompt.md
```

### Shell Prompt Shows "$(aicheck_prompt)"

This is expected! It means the AICheck shell integration is working. The status will display properly once you're in a project with an active action.

### Commands Not Found

If commands aren't recognized:
```bash
# Reload your shell configuration
source ~/.zshrc  # Or source ~/.bashrc for Bash users
```
