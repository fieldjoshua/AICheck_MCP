## Issue 1: Implement LLM Confidence Visualization System

**Labels:** enhancement

**Description:**

### Purpose

Implement a visualization system that colors text based on OpenAI model log probabilities to help users understand LLM output confidence levels. This feature enables evaluation of system prompt effectiveness, model temperature calibration, and filtering of low-confidence outputs.

### Requirements

- OpenAI API integration with log probabilities enabled
- Async API client implementation
- Color mapping system for probability visualization
- Interactive chat interface
- Real-time token confidence display
- HTML/CSS colored text output
- Probability calculation utilities

### Dependencies

- OpenAI Python SDK (AsyncOpenAI)
- Panel (for interactive chat interface)
- NumPy (probability calculations)
- TastyMap (color palette generation)

### Implementation Approach

#### Phase 1: Research & Setup
- Analyze OpenAI API log probabilities format
- Research color palette strategies for probability visualization
- Set up development environment with required dependencies
- Create basic project structure

#### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- Implement OpenAI API client with log probabilities
- Create probability-to-color mapping functions
- Build colored text rendering system
- Develop async chat interface foundation

#### Phase 3: Visualization Features
- Implement dynamic color palette generation
- Create interactive confidence threshold controls
- Add probability percentage display
- Build comparison tools for different model parameters

#### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement
- Test with various prompts and model configurations
- Validate color accuracy across different probability ranges
- Performance testing for real-time rendering
- User experience testing and refinement

### Success Criteria

- Functional OpenAI API integration with log probabilities
- Accurate color mapping from log probabilities to visual representation
- Interactive chat interface displaying colored confidence text
- Real-time visualization of token generation confidence
- Configurable color palettes and confidence thresholds
- Documentation and usage examples

### Estimated Timeline

- Research & Setup: 1 day
- Core Implementation: 2 days
- Visualization Features: 2 days
- Testing & Refinement: 1 day
- **Total: 6 days**

### Notes

This implementation follows the approach from the HoloViz blog post, focusing on practical visualization of LLM confidence levels for better understanding of model behavior and output reliability.

## Issue 2: Complete Test Status Bar Implementation

**Labels:** enhancement, testing

**Description:**

### Purpose

Complete the test status bar implementation that was started but not fully specified.

### Status

- Progress shows 100% but status is "Not Started" - needs clarification
- Requirements section is incomplete (placeholder text)
- Dependencies section is incomplete

### Action Required

1. Define specific requirements for the test status bar
2. Identify what functionality is needed
3. Determine if this relates to AICheck testing infrastructure
4. Complete the implementation or close if no longer needed

### Notes

This action appears to be incomplete and may need to be redefined or closed.
